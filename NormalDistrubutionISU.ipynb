In reality, we usually cannot collect the complete dataset of a whole population. Thus, we often take random samples of the population and estimate these statistic parameters based on the samples.\nGiven a sample of n observations from a population, we can calculate estimates of the population mean, standard deviation, and various other population characteristics (parameters). Prior to obtaining the complete dataset, there is uncertainty as to which of all possible samples will occur. Because of this, estimates such as mean and deviation will vary from one sample to another. The behavior of such estimates in repeated sampling is described by what are called sampling distributions. Any particular sampling distribution will give an indication of how close the estimate is likely to be to the value of the parameter being estimated.\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem states that if you have a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ and take sufficiently large (n≥30) random samples from the population with replacement, then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed.\nSampling can be done with or without replacement. If with replacement, the same data point could appear more than once in a sample.\nPlease note: in this lab, you should use for loop to iterate all data and perform required calculations. You are not allowed to directly use built-in functions max(); min(); sum(); and mean() from statistics module. You can use len() if needed.\n\nDataset: we assume the following 100 weights to be a complete population, and thus can accurately calculate some important parameters of this dataset: [112.99,136.49,153.03,142.34,144.3,123.3,141.49,136.46,112.37,120.67,127.45,114.14,125.61,122.46,116.09,140,129.5,142.97,137.9,124.04,141.28,143.54,97.9,129.5,141.85,129.72,142.42,131.55,108.33,113.89,103.3,120.75,125.79,136.22,140.1,128.75,141.8,121.23,131.35,106.71,124.36,124.86,139.67,137.37,106.45,128.76,145.68,116.82,143.62,134.93,147.02,126.33,125.48,115.71,123.49,147.89,155.9,128.07,119.37,133.81,128.73,137.55,129.76,128.82,135.32,109.61,142.47,132.75,103.53,124.73,129.31,134.02,140.4,102.84,128.52,120.3,138.6,132.96,115.62,122.52,134.63,121.9,155.38,128.94,129.1,139.47,140.89,131.59,121.12,131.51,136.55,141.49,140.61,112.14,133.46,131.8,120.03,123.1,128.14,115.48]\n\nThis dataset will be given in a cvs file format.
