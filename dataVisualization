DATA VISUALIZATION section:
I used Covid data instead of car data for this Udemy course.
Being in the middle of the second winter wave of COVID in 2021,
I found Covid data to be more useful and has been something I want to start analyzing.

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

df=pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\sschm\Desktop\worldometer_data.csv')
country=df['Country/Region'][0:5]
deaths=df['TotalDeaths'][0:5]
plt.bar(country, deaths)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.xlabel("Country")
plt.title("Covid Data", fontsize=16, fontweight="bold")
plt.ylabel("Number of Deaths")
#Eplt.show()


'''
Barcharts should be considered using first for graphs.
Using a barchart should start from 0 on the Y axis, otherwise it can disort the data.

Even though pie charts are the most common type of chart but comes with many disavantages.
A barchart should be the "go to". A pie chart can only be used if the data adds up to 100%.
Also, a pie chart should not be used if there are too many catergories.

Creating a piechart in numPy seems to be easier on first impression.
This was not an official part of the Udemy course.
